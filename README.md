* start the server ```python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000```

Use WebDAV
===========

As for Mac OS X Users, open Finder, Click Go -> Connect Server ->
Input http://<host:port>/ and Press connect. You need to input the username and password which are aws access id and aws access secret.

If there is no odd things happen a explorer window appears with several folder corresponding to your buckets, good luck!

Tips
===========

Tied of input the human unreadable aws access id and secret? You are lucky to make a shortcuts. 

Visit http://<host:port>/admin/ input the admin username and password created during db synchronization. Add an user with password, then add a S3Account object. Link the user and fill access id and secret with it. You can type the username and password at the webdav prompt know!
